# Lecturely
Online lectures suck. Lecturely is a revolutionary new platform to change that.

Lecturely allows students to create a room, share it, and study together.

Within a room, Lecturely provides synchronous video playing (with support for pauses, rewinds, skips) and chat functionality.

From room data, Lecturely provides unparalleled AI-powered analytics on the lecture recording for the difficult sections.
- Students will be able to see this and discuss with their lecture peers accordingly.
- Teachers will be able to see this and improve their future lectures and content.
